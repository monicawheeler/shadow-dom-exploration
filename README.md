# GitHub 30 Day Challenge

The purpose of this repo is to gather ideas, code snippets, and anything else pertaining to a new topic I want to cover. 

> I commit to 30 days of learning and exploration around this topic:

## Shadow DOM

Some planning and brainstorming: 
*Day 1:*
- Create GitHub project with a README and explain the purpose:
  - Goal of this effort is to spend ~30 minutes a day reviewing and researching a topic
- Exploring Shadow DOM as a topic


*Day 2+ Questions to answer:*
- What does the Shadow DOM look like? And why is it called Shadow DOM? What is it?!?!
- Can we demo it quickly? 
- Can we create thorough examples? 
- Is it easy to implement? 
- Why havenâ€™t we heard about this so much? 
- Why should I use it? Does this solve a problem we have or will have?
- Is it scalable? 
- Is it well documented? 
- Who is responsible for the Shadow DOM code? ENG, UXD?
- Is it secure? Are there security implications? 
- Who created this? Why? 
- Who is the leading expert in this area? 
- Who should I be following?
- Poll Slack: I haven't heard much about Shadow DOM, do you know what it is? No cheating (aka, no internet searches)!

This is the start of my ideas and questions I have. For now, what I learn and understand will be gathered in this repo for reference. I will break each day into a journel entry so I can keep track of what I learned.
