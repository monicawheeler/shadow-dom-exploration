Is it scalable?

- Continuing on the journey of web components and why use them I read a little bit on reddit regarding performance and one guy testing 50 components doesn't really do the performance question justice, so that will still be a point of further research. 

[Smashing discusses web components](
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/07/reusable-components-custom-elements-shadow-dom-npm/) and that is what I am looking at for current reading. 


Is it well documented?

- I would say that documentation is vast and easy to digest. This has not been difficult for me to learn.

Still need to discover the social aspect of this topic:

Who created this? Why?
Who is the leading expert in this area?
Who should I be following?
Poll Slack: I haven't heard much about Shadow DOM, do you know what it is? No cheating (aka, no internet searches)!
