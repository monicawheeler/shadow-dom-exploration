# Day 6 - Create a Web Component! 

TODO's 

- [X] Continue exploring the custom banner web component

## Notes:

I created a custom element using JavaScript, defining the `custom-banner` and assigning it a class.

You can extend an existing HTML element or use one that does not inherit anything from existing elements.

I created my custom element without inherit anything from existing elements.

In the class, I want to determine what it is the banner will do. AND this is where we can create the Shadow DOM! 

Tomorrow, I will plan everything that this banner needs to do and explore creating the Shadow DOM in practice!
