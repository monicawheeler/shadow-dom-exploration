# Day 18

Plans for the weekend for learning: take a break. Today and tomorrow will be empty journals but the reason for that is because it is important to take a break and recharge. Developers are notorious for burnout and I have a 14 month old. Yeah, I am exhausted. I might try and sleep this weekend!
