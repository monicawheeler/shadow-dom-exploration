# Day 23

Since today was a crazy busy day, I didn't have time to learn anything more/go through any more videos. I did want to reflect on what I have been learning thus far. 

- The Shadow DOM is part of a larger set of tools under the Web Component umbrella

- Creating a custom element is typically used along with Shadow DOM

- Custom elements can be present on page load or loading into the DOM via callbacks

- The Shadow DOM is used to encapsulate the entire structure, style, and functionality of a component
