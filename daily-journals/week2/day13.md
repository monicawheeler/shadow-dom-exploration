# Day 13

Today was supposed to be the exploration of adding a click event, however, after many errors. I decided to put that on hold. I am not really understanding events within the Shadow DOM yet. I will do a little in depth research on this tomorrow. Perhaps brush up on simple click events without considering the Shadow DOM.

Once I nail the click event, I am going to revisit the questions I had at the beginning of this exercise! Till tomorrow!
