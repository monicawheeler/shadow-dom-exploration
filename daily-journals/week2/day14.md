# Day 14

Click events.

- This is something I really need to nail, like really know, and I don't. I know how to do a click event in jQuery but I haven't touched them since March and really this shows just how much you lose if you don't practice it regularly.

- So what do I need to do, let's MDN it. https://codepen.io/frogmcw/pen/oaEvVE

- So I created a button, added a text container, and appended text from the value of the button. This worked great.

- I also experimented with a mouseover event and that seemed to work well to. 

- I will try another go at the click event in the Shadow DOM tomorrow
