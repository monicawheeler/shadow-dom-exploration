#Day 1 - Exploration and planning

*TODO's Today* 
[X] - Plan and create rep
[ ] - Figure out a basic definition of the Shadow DOM
[ ] - Document

##Start by searching Google! As of today: 
- The first result is an article written by Dimitri Glazkov in 2011, titled, "What the Heck is Shadow DOM?"
  - https://glazkov.com/2011/01/14/what-the-heck-is-shadow-dom/
  - This article is also quoted as the main definition answer in Google for Shadow DOM
- The second result is a 2018 article from MDN titled, "Using shadow DOM - Web Components" 
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM


###Thoughts so far: 
The top two results are both referring to Shadow DOM as "Shadow DOM" and not "the Shadow DOM". There are also some differences in capitalization. *Questions added below to explore further.*

In the Google section for "People also ask", there is a question listed that says, "What is virtual DOM?" Is the shadow DOM and virtual DOM different? *Let's explore that to make this clear, question*

##Top 5 Search results on DuckDuckGo:
- Lists same MDN article above, first
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM
- An article on W3
  - https://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom/
- Dimitri Glazkov's article

- "Shadow DOM v1: Self-Contained Web Components" from Google
  - https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/shadowdom



Questions gathered:
[X] - Is there a proper way to refer to it? "Shadow DOM" verses "the Shadow DOM"
[X] - Is "shadow" capitalized? 
[X] - Is the shadow DOM and virtual DOM different? Clarify.


### Basic understanding after very simple research and reading, so far:
- MDN uses "the Shadow DOM" with "the" and capitalizing the "S" in "Shadow"
  - I like the way this feels and sounds as we refer to the DOM as "the DOM" and not "DOM"
- The Shadow DOM and virtual DOM are different, the virtual DOM is about performance and the Shadow DOM is about encapsulation
