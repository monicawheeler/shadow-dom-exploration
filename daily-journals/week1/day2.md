# Day 2 - Exploration and planning

*TODO's Today* 

[X] - Figure out a basic definition of the Shadow DOM (carry over from day 1)

Notes:

- The Shadow DOM allows hidden DOM trees to be attached to elements in the regular DOM tree

- You have a *shadow host* that is the regular DOM node that the Shadow DOM is attached to

- You have a *shadow tree* that is the DOM tree inside of the Shadow DOM

- Then there is the shadow boundary and shadow root



Questions from reading:

- [ ] How does the hidden DOM trees get added?

- [ ] How does the hidden DOM trees get removed? 

- [ ] What is the shadow boundary and shadow root?
