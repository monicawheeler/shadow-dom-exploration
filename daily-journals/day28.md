# Day 28

Today is the last day for the challenge and I wanted to reflect on the process of learning in this manner. 

Some things I learned:

- I love the obligation to a challenge that requires me to focus on something for a little every dya

- I absolutely cannot do a challenge like this every month because my schedule is so jammed (I only have time in the morning to work on this)

- I learned a lot and feel so much more confident in understanding what the Shadow DOM is and why it's important

- This was fun but I look forward to doing my own self-guided learning going forward for a while :)
