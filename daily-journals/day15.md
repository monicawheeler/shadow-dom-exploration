What does the Shadow DOM look like? And why is it called Shadow DOM? What is it?!?!

- The shadow dom is another dom tree inside or attached, to a regular dom element. it holds the html, css, and javascript for that dom tree. the idea of the shadow dom is to create custom elements that encapsulate everything for that element. this is cool because all the styles and functionality is isolated to that element

Can we demo it quickly?

- i would say the process can be moderate in the amount of time it takes to spin up a custom element with a shadow dom

Can we create thorough examples?

- yes this is still something that i meed to explore further

Is it easy to implement?

- i would say it takes some effort and forethought to implement. not that it's difficult but it can get complex 

Why havenâ€™t we heard about this so much?

- i think it takes some time to really grasp so it might not have a quick adoption

Why should I use it? Does this solve a problem we have or will have?
Is it scalable?
Is it well documented?
Who is responsible for the Shadow DOM code? ENG, UXD?

- both lots of collaboration

Is it secure? Are there security implications?

- this meeds more exploration

Who created this? Why?
Who is the leading expert in this area?
Who should I be following?
Poll Slack: I haven't heard much about Shadow DOM, do you know what it is? No cheating (aka, no internet searches)!
